# Comprehensive Report: Which files do we have and what do they contain?

## Introduction  
This report provides a detailed overview of the files currently available within the project archive as of 2025-10-23. The holdings consist of documents and images that represent planning, architectural design, and system modeling related to the ongoing project phases in Q4 2025. The files are organized first by type—PDF documents and images—and then grouped by their relevance to project sprint planning and system architecture work. Each file is described with its contents and includes precise source references for validation and further review.

## PDF Documents

### Overview  
The PDF file contained within the archive provides an extensive planning framework for sprint activities planned for Q4. It outlines task assignments, deadlines, responsible teams, and deliverable statuses relevant to the development phases 3.1 and 3.2 of the project, focusing on requirements and architecture.

### Listed File

- **File Name:** AP3_RUB_Final_Sprint Planung Q4.pdf  
  **Description:**  
  This document details the sprint planning activities for Q4 with a particular focus on two overlapping sprints targeting requirements (phase 3.1) and architecture (phase 3.2). It includes:  
  - Sprint goals outlining the development of the first version of the system architecture blueprint based on Tractus-X principles.  
  - Collection, validation, analysis, and clustering of use case requirements to consolidate input for architectural decisions.  
  - Development tasks related to system and software architecture, with clear assignments to teams and individuals.  
  - Detailed lists of thematic units and application scenarios, along with responsible teams/persons and their corresponding deadlines and status updates for deliverables.  
  - Criteria for sprint reviews and status tracking mechanisms for epics, architecture visualization, and consolidated requirement documents.  
  **Source Reference:**  
  - File location: `./knowledge/documents/AP3_RUB_Final_Sprint Planung Q4.pdf`  
  - Relevant pages: 1, 2, 4

## Image Files

### Overview  
The image file available in the archive is a comprehensive visual representation of the system architecture related to the project's reference process model. It depicts complex semantic and structural components, demonstrating the integration of standards, data models, and governance frameworks central to the architecture.

### Listed File

- **File Name:** AP3.2_RUB_WIP_Systemstruktur_2025-10-21.png  
  **Description:**  
  This PNG image is a diagram illustrating the architecture of a reference process model. It includes:  
  - Key architectural components such as vocabularies, standards, semantic models, and ontologies that define the information structure.  
  - UML class diagrams and transaction tables highlighting relationships and data flows within the architecture.  
  - Elements associated with digital wallets and identity services including identifiers and certificates, emphasizing security and identity management.  
  - Policies and governance frameworks integrated into the model to ensure compliance and operational control.  
  - Visual depiction of interconnections and roles among these components within a data-centric architectural environment, aiding in high-level understanding and technical discussions.

## Conclusion  
The current file holdings consist of two main files: a detailed sprint planning PDF document and a comprehensive architectural diagram image. Together, these files cover critical aspects of project management for Q4 2025 and the underlying architectural design and standards framework. The sprint planning document is vital for tracking progress, responsibilities, and deliverables related to requirements and architecture development. The architectural diagram provides essential visualization for understanding the system’s structure and integration points.

No gaps in immediate coverage are evident within the scope of requirements and architecture as outlined for Q4. Further review could focus on inclusion of additional documents such as detailed requirement specifications, software design artifacts, or implementation reports as they become available. For now, these files represent the core planning and architectural reference materials.
